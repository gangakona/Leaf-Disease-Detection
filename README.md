# Leaf-Disease-Detection
Leaf diseases pose a significant threat to the agricultural industry, leading to substantial crop yield losses and economic impact. Early and accurate detection of these diseases is crucial for implementing timely interventions to prevent widespread crop damage. This paper introduces an automated system for leaf disease detection leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques.Pre-processing techniques are applied to enhance image quality, and feature extraction methods are employed to highlight key patterns indicative of disease presence. A dataset comprising images of healthy and diseased leaves is used for training a deep learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), to learn and recognize disease patterns.
Results demonstrate high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in disease identification, showcasing the system's potential as a valuable tool in precision agriculture using Random Forest as a Classifier.By automating the process of leaf disease detection, this system contributes to the sustainable management of agricultural resources, minimizing the use of pesticides and fostering early disease control strategies. Furthermore, its user-friendly interface ensures accessibility for farmers with varying levels of technological expertise, facilitating widespread adoption and enhancing overall crop health management practices
